# Changelog

Notable changes to Marginalia. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions follow semver.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-07-23

The reading comfort release.

### Added

- **Calm scrolling** (off by default, options page). While an answer
  streams, the view follows only its first few lines and then holds still —
  no more text racing past faster than you can read. A circled scroll-down
  button inside the thread marks the text growing below; click it (or
  scroll to the bottom yourself) to jump to the newest text and follow
  along again. Works in margin boxes, the maximized view, and Across-chats
  synthesis.
- **Full-width input.** The composer's input now spans the whole box; the
  MD toggle and Ask button moved to a slim row underneath, so typing room
  is never traded for buttons.
- **Labels in the maximized view.** The label section (chips, ×-remove,
  pencil editor) now appears under the maximized view's header too, and
  `/label` typed there updates it in place — full parity with the margin
  box.

### Fixed

- Minimizing the maximized view with an empty input no longer collapses the
  margin box's input to a sliver.
- With calm scrolling off, the maximized view and the synthesis panel now
  respect your scroll position while streaming (stick-follow, like the
  margin boxes) instead of yanking to the bottom on every update.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-07-22

The composer comfort release.

### Added

- **Drafts follow you.** Text typed in a margin box travels into the
  maximized view's input when you expand, and any unsent text comes back to
  the box when you close it.
- **Markdown toggle.** A small MD button on the composer (margin box and
  maximized view) lets you choose, per message, whether what you send is
  rendered as markdown — code fences, lists and all — in your own bubble.
  The choice is remembered on the message, so it survives reloads. Plain
  Enter inside an unclosed ``` fence now inserts a newline instead of
  sending (Ctrl/Cmd+Enter always sends).
- **Resizable input in the maximized view.** A drag grip above the input
  lets you pull it as tall as half the window; double-click the grip to
  return to auto-grow. The margin boxes keep their compact auto-size.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-22

The labels & cross-conversation synthesis release: annotations become
organizable (labels with dotted namespaces) and mineable across every
conversation you've annotated.

### Added

- **Labels.** Type `/label "name"` in any thread composer. In a thread with
  history it attaches labels (editable in place via the pencil in the label
  section under the header; the minimized chip gains a tag icon). In an EMPTY
  thread it converts the record into a standalone label — a violet tag chip
  that marks the whole LLM answer, with its own in-chip editor. Compound
  labels use dotted namespaces (`project.ux.nav`); multiple labels per item.
- **"Across chats" tab in the threads panel.** Search threads across every
  stored conversation, or flip the Threads|Labels segmented control and pick
  from a namespace-grouped picker (selecting `project` matches everything
  under `project.*`). Matched threads and labeled answers list for curation.
- **Cross-conversation synthesis.** With items selected, a prompt bar
  appears: ask for a summary / common patterns and the bundle (thread
  discussions + the transcript text of labeled answers) goes to the current
  provider, streaming into the panel. Labeled answers resolve by inflating
  only their own per-message blob; the whole-conversation decode runs only on
  a fingerprint miss, and a missing transcript degrades to the stored
  section text.
- **Output actions.** "Download .md" saves the output verbatim under a
  small provenance header (date, prompt, sources) — no second LLM round-trip.
  "Copy & open new chat" copies the output and opens the provider's new-chat
  page (none of the sites expose a create-conversation API, so paste-to-start
  is the honest version of this feature).
- Transcript exports now include a **Labels:** line in annotation callouts.

### Changed (UX pass, same release)

- **Labeling got a visible door.** A tag button on every comment box opens
  label entry directly — no syntax to learn; `/label` remains the typed
  power path (the empty-box placeholder hints it).
- **One label editor everywhere.** The thread label section now uses the
  same pill-by-pill editor as the tag chip (× removes one, the input adds);
  the raw-text editor with its quoting rules is gone.
- **Tag chips are label-first.** The chip leads with the tag name you wrote
  (extras as "+N", pencil on hover); the highlight snippet trails muted.
- **Synthesis output is a run log.** A second prompt appends below a divider
  instead of silently replacing the previous answer; a failed run puts the
  typed prompt back in the composer; "Gathering the selected items…" shows
  while sources resolve.
- The synthesis footer is always visible on the Across-chats tab with a
  short how-to hint; submitting with nothing selected explains itself.
- Label names are capped at 64 characters and can't contain `"` — they flow
  into pills, chips, and toasts sized for tags.
- Escape no longer closes the panel over a typed-but-unsent prompt (first
  press blurs, second closes); long content stopped clipping (toast widths,
  pill remove buttons, tab wrapping on narrow windows); focus rings, hover
  states, and reduced-motion coverage filled in across the new controls.

### Fixed (post-review, same release)

- Closing the panel while a synthesis bundle was still resolving no longer
  dispatches the provider request for the dead panel.
- Labels appended via the modal's `/label` now render on the docked box as
  soon as the modal closes (previously stale until reload).
- Re-picking a label after changing the selection no longer resurrects stale
  curation unchecks; label names containing a double quote are rejected
  (they could never round-trip through the editors).

## 0.2.2 — 2026-07-18

The modal UX release.

### Added

- **Drag-resizable modal.** The full-screen thread view resizes from either
  edge (width clamped to the viewport) and remembers the chosen width for
  the rest of the page session.
- **Live-stream late-join.** Opening the modal while an answer is still
  streaming into the docked box picks the stream up mid-sentence instead of
  waiting for the turn to finish (shared feed in `core/live-stream.js`).
- **Minimize on expand.** While a thread is maximized, its docked box tucks
  to a chip (transient — never persisted) and restores to its prior state
  when the modal closes.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-07-17

The math release.

### Added

- **Math rendering.** TeX notation in replies (`\frac{a}{b}`, Greek letters,
  super/subscripts, common operators) renders as Unicode math in boxes and
  the modal — a lightweight TeX→Unicode prettifier, no external math engine.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-13

The transcript & durability release: annotated conversations are now captured
as full transcripts, exportable for NotebookLM, and every layer of thread
storage got hardened against data loss.

### Added

- **Conversation transcript capture.** Annotated conversations are captured
  into local storage from the live page — accumulated across visits and
  scrolls in both directions, so virtualized message lists still yield the
  whole conversation over time. Message text is gzip-compressed per turn;
  capture runs on annotate, on revisit, and after streaming settles.
- **Export for NotebookLM.** One-click button in the threads panel renders
  the captured transcript plus your annotations to Markdown (NotebookLM- and
  Obsidian-ready), downloads it, and copies it to the clipboard. Annotations
  appear as callouts under the turn they were written on; mid-stream partial
  duplicates are collapsed at render time.
- **Backup export / import.** Options page can export all threads and
  transcripts to a JSON archive and restore it later — additive merge (safe
  union, content-max conflict resolution) or wholesale replace. Restores can
  never touch settings or API keys by construction.
- **Options shortcut.** Gear button in the threads panel opens the options
  page directly.

### Fixed

- **Wedged transcript index (F6).** Annotating while an answer was still
  streaming (or before a turn finished hydrating) indexed the turn under a
  fingerprint that never appeared again, permanently freezing the transcript
  at that first window — the NotebookLM export then contained only the
  annotated turns. Capture now recognizes a stored partial that a live turn
  grew out of and upgrades it in place; exports self-heal older wedged
  records (export once, revisit, export again — the second export is
  complete); annotations anchored to a vanished partial re-home onto the
  completed turn by their quoted text.
- **Draft retention (T-004).** Draft conversations with content are never
  auto-deleted; only provably stale empty drafts are swept.
- **Restore isolation.** One malformed stored thread can no longer abort the
  restore loop and hide every other annotation in the conversation; the bad
  record is skipped and left intact for later migration.

## 0.1.1 — earlier store update

- Anchoring rework: threads pin to their message via turn discovery + content
  fingerprinting; anchors that contradict recorded context are rejected
  instead of guessed. Fixed two dead site adapters (Gemini, Claude).
- Threads panel: keyword search across all threads; focus mode (opening one
  thread collapses the rest); composer-local undo/redo (Ctrl+Z).
- UI polish pass: flat host-matched colors, unified counters, elevation
  system, calmer chips; panel button moved bottom-right; fixed Alt shortcuts
  on macOS. Fixed Firefox anchoring probe and highlight scroll lag.
- Renamed to Marginalia; added privacy policy for store listings.

## 0.1.0 — initial release

- Margin annotations ("threads") on Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude
  conversations: highlight text in an answer, attach a comment thread, and
  ask a model follow-up questions inside the thread.
- Official-API backends (OpenAI, Google AI, Anthropic) with per-provider
  key + model settings; Gemini/Claude fall back to the logged-in web session
  without a key.
- Firefox and Chrome builds; functional-core/imperative-shell architecture
  with a Vitest suite.
